## What's S5? What's S6?

Simple Standards-based Slide Show System (S5) is Eric Meyer's (of CSS fame) public domain
(free, open source) slide show package inspired by Opera Show and others that works
in all modern browsers without any plugin required
because it includes its own slide show machinery in JavaScript.
More [S5 Project Site »](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5)

S6 started as a rewrite of S5 using the jQuery JavaScript library - offering
easier to understand and easier to extend code. Add plugins, effects and more.
Contributions welcome!
